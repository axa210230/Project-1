*The project will be implemented as three separate programs. There will be a logger – responsible
for logging all activity. There will be an encryption program – responsible for encrypting and
decrypting strings. There will be a driver program that will interact with the user to use the
encryption program. The entire system will be ran by running the driver program, which will
launch the other programs and communicate with them through pipes.*
